# Trinity Bank SMS paste

This add-on removes event listeners on the input field of the authorization code form from SMS, allowing the code to be copied and pasted directly from the message.

Trinity Bank requires two-factor authentication for logging into online banking using an authorization code sent via SMS. After entering your username and date of birth, you will receive a nine-digit authorization code via SMS, which you then enter into the designated field in the form to complete the login process.
